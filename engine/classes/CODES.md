<h2>Status Codes</h2>
<p>Here is the list of status codes. Every class must have its <b>own area of codes</b> that is why they grouped by the classes. Plenty of codes can be received from the AJAX request and few of them can appear in the normal mode as an error (most often due to incorrect use of the programmer).</p>
